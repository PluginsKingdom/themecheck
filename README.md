# themecheck.org

Themecheck.org is a free service that allows to test web themes or templates.
Dozens of tests are run to check best practice compliance : CMS standards, security, malware, coding style, use of deprecated functions, etc.

This service is compatible with Wordpress and Joomla themes. More CMS will be added later on.

It is as a fork of the theme-check plugin for wordpress (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/).

Please add your contribution to improve the checks !
